              Welcome to LÃ©a's (@lea31) account !
              <br />
              Well done! You have successfully completed this challenge. In the
              notes section, you will find what you are looking for ;)
              <br />
              Now, don't forget your goal! Go and see what's hidden on your
              girlfriend Alexia's account to see if she really cheats on you!
              <br />
              For that, the account of Kevin, Alexia's brother, can surely help
              you to find more information to find Alexia's credentials.
              <br />
              But if you are not afraid to go through difficult places and you
              are an OSINT expert, you can surely stay on this account to reach
              your goal!

                Maybe if you pretend to be the real Kevin (her brother) in the
                messages, Alexia will answer you with love! Imagine you ask her
                the password of her account... it would be incredible that she
                answers...
